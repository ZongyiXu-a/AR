This branch contains four MATLAB scripts for data analysis related to the project 'Deep brain stimulation alleviates Parkinsonian motor deficits through desynchronizing GABA release in mice'. The script 'Alpha_synapse_fitting_2024' was used to fit SR events using an alpha-synapse function. The 'Analysis_total_SR_AR_charge_2024' script was used to quantify total charge, SR charge, AR charge, and basal current. The 'Cell_attached_Spike_frequency_CV_artifact_removal' script was used to calculate spike frequency and the coefficient of variation (CV) from cell-attached recordings, with artifact removal and the 'Whole_cell_Spike_frequency_CV script' was used for similar analyses based on whole-cell recordings.
